 üß† Packet Tracer - Configure a Wireless Router and Clients

 üìò Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world **home network setup** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
The goal is to help a homeowner (Natsumi) connect her home devices ‚Äî PCs, a laptop, and a television ‚Äî to the internet through a cable modem and a wireless router.

The lab demonstrates essential networking skills including:

* Connecting devices with correct cabling.
* Configuring a home wireless router.
* Setting up DHCP and IP addressing.
* Enabling secure Wi-Fi.
* Testing end-to-end connectivity.

### üñ•Ô∏è Part 2: Configure the Wireless Router

1. **Access Router GUI**

   * On Office PC ‚Üí `Desktop > IP Configuration > DHCP`
   * Open Web Browser ‚Üí Enter **Default Gateway IP (Router IP)**
   * Login credentials: `admin / admin`

2. **Set Basic Configuration**

   * Change **Maximum Number of Users** (DHCP) to `10`.
   * Save Settings.
   * Change **Admin Password**: `MyPassword1!`

3. **Configure Wireless Network**

   * Enable **2.4 GHz Network**.
   * Set **SSID:** `MyHome`
   * Security: **WPA2 Personal**
   * Passphrase: `MyPassPhrase1!`
   * Save and apply settings.

---

### üíª Part 3: Configure Clients and Test Connectivity

1. **Laptop (Wireless Connection)**

   * Go to `Desktop > PC Wireless > Connect`
   * Select SSID: `MyHome`
   * Enter Passphrase: `MyPassPhrase1!`
   * Obtain IP via DHCP (should start with 192.168.x.x)
   * Verify connectivity: Open Web Browser ‚Üí `skillsforall.srv`

2. **Office PC (Wired Connection)**

   * Already connected to router.
   * Test connectivity: Web Browser ‚Üí `skillsforall.srv`

3. **Bedroom PC (Wired Connection)**

   * Configure DHCP in IP Configuration.
   * Test connectivity: Web Browser ‚Üí `skillsforall.srv`

## üöß Problems Encountered & Solutions

| **Problem**                                | **Cause**                                     | **Solution**                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TV not displaying any program**          | Incorrect coaxial connection                  | Reconnected Coaxial1 to Cable Modem and Coaxial2 to TV. Turned ON TV to verify.                   |
| **Office PC not getting IP address**       | DHCP delay in Packet Tracer simulation        | Used **Fast Forward Time** to speed up DHCP process.                                              |
| **Router GUI inaccessible**                | Office PC not receiving gateway address       | Toggled between **DHCP** and **Static** to refresh configuration.                                 |
| **Wireless network not visible on Laptop** | Wireless interface disabled or SSID not saved | Enabled 2.4 GHz network and re-saved **SSID: MyHome** in router settings.                         |
| **Laptop connected but no internet**       | DHCP lease delay                              | Used **Fast Forward Time** multiple times to obtain valid IP and establish internet connectivity. |
| **Login lost after saving settings**       | Router reboots after admin password change    | Re-authenticated using new credentials: `admin / MyPassword1!`.                                   |
